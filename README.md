# Your-Norm

This is a blog application made with MERN stack. I am making this app to practice and devlop my skills and hopefully learn alot of new once which could help me in the future. You may also run this app on you computer using ./run.sh file but you should have docker engine installed on you computer. just run `./run.sh build` command and the react app will open at port 3000 and the backend will be visible at port 8000, thought it is not needed to expose the backend to the outside world but yet I have done that for testing purposes, You may remove the port section from the docker-compose file if you want, the application will run fine with or without it. The files will also generate a folder names "YourNormData" as I have binded it with the database service to keep track of my data and so that I do not have to fill it again and again during development.
